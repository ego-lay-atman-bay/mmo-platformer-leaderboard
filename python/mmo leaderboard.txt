[b][big]Hello all! . . . . (Last Update: April 27, 2022)[/big][/b]
[b](This is for that [url=https://turbowarp.org/612229554]griffpatch game[/url])[/b]

This is one of the most active speedrunning scenes on scratch right now, so please come and join in on the fun! The game is very accessible, and the run is very fun to pull off! So go, speedrun the game, and submit your times here to get recognized by the community as a whole! This forum is largely for the leaderboard and for a soon-to-be-released speedrun guide, so for help and community, I recommend the [url=https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30967864/comments]MMO Platformer Speedrunning Studio[/url].

[b]PLEASE[/b]: If you have submitted a time here or on the studio and are waiting for it to be put on the leaderboard, [u]please wait until [i]after[/i] I post an update confirmation here on the forum[/u] before reaching out to me. Once I say "Times are updated", if your time [i]still[/i] isn't updated, [b]THEN[/b] you can ask.
[b]ALSO[/b]: [u]Do [i]not[/i] quote this message[/u]. It doesn't make you "more likely to be seen", it just clogs up the forum. Thank you!

When running, use this project. It's better for proof - [url=https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/655987072/]MMO Speedrunning Build[/url]

[big][u][b]GENERAL RULES[/b][/u][/big]:[list]
[*]Please use the format above when submitting runs!
[*][u][b]Don't cheat[/b][/u]. Speedrunning is a gentleman's sport, and there's no glory in cheating. You will be caught, and if you're ever allowed to post times again, your future runs will require [i]much[/i] more rigorous proof.
[*]If you're submitting a run, please [b][u]post proof in the form of a screenshot[/u][/b] of your time.
[small]I recommend using [url=https://lightshot.en.softonic.com/]Lightshot[/url], a safe, free app that lets you save pictures of your screen. Once you have it, just press the PRTSCN key, select the portion of your screen to screenshot, then press Ctrl+S to save it to your computer. You can then put that image into a scratch project, and link the project here. If you're using a screenshot as proof, please exit fullscreen on the project to include the exact project you're running. I'm hoping this will dissuade cheating.[/small]
[*]From now on, I would really [i]really[/i] prefer [u][b]top runners start recording their runs[/b][/u]. This goes for anyone posting a top 10 time.
[small]The application I use for recording is called [url=https://obsproject.com/]OBS[/url], it's a safe, free screen-capture software that will let you record your runs. The settings I use are 960x720 video output, and a display capture that I zoom in on the game. To edit the videos, you can either trim them via your PC's built-in photos app or download a free video editing software ([url=https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/?gclid=CjwKCAiAyPyQBhB6EiwAFUuakkPng3zJkPZRRpQUQMs3bMLOrMGUcyHLztoubLSwr2ZJJ_0O-ghW8BoCCgkQAvD_BwE]Davinci Resolve[/url] and [url=https://fxhome.com/product/hitfilm-express]Hitfilm[/url] are great options).[/small] 
[*]The [u][b]only[/b][/u] time you should reach out to me about adding a time to the leaderboard [b][u]is if you posted it here (to the forum) [i]BEFORE[/i] my most recent "all times updated" post[/u][/b]. If you posted your time to the forum before my update post and it's still not up, that means I missed it. In every other circumstance, just wait for me to update the leaderboard.
[*][u][b]PLEASE do NOT quote this leaderboard post[/u][/b]. From now on, if you quote this message, I will Not add your time to the leaderboard until you edit your message to take out the quote. This post has gotten to be over 200 lines long, and it clogs up the forum whenever it's quoted. It doesn't make me more likely to see your time. In fact, it makes it harder for me to see your time, so just keep your messages brief.
